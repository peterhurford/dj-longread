http://moralitylab.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/YoungDurwin2013.pdf,Moral Realism As Moral Motivation: The Impact of Meta-ethics on Everyday Decision Making,"&nbsp;&ldquo;People disagree about whether &lsquo;moral facts&rsquo; are objective facts like mathematical truths (moral realism) or simply products of the human mind (moral antirealism). What is the impact of different meta-ethical views on actual behavior? In Experiment 1, a street canvasser, soliciting donations for a charitable organization dedicated to helping impoverished children, primed passersby with realism or antirealism. Participants primed with realism were twice as likely to be donors, compared to control participants and participants primed with antirealism. In Experiment 2, online participants primed with realism as opposed to antirealism reported being willing to donate more money to a charity of their choice. Considering the existence of non-negotiable moral facts may have raised the stakes and motivated participants to behave better. These results therefore reveal the impact of meta-ethics on everyday decision-making: priming a belief in moral realism improved moral behavior.&rdquo;",moralitylab.bc.edu,2016-12-06,1.0,ethics,custom

Motivated by this interest, I recently setup a conversation with a hot shot young professor who rose quickly in his field. I asked him about his work habits. Though his answer was detailed &mdash; he had obviously put great thought into these issues &mdash; there was one strategy that caught my attention: he confines his deep work to long, uninterrupted bursts. On small time scales, this means each day is either completely dedicated to a single deep work task, or is left open to deal with all the e-mail and meetings and revisions that also define academic life. If he&rsquo;s going to write a paper, for example, he puts aside two days, and does nothing else, emerging from his immersion with a completed first draft. If he&rsquo;s going to instead deal with requests and logistics, he&rsquo;ll spend the whole day doing so.&rdquo;",calnewport.com,2016-12-08,1.0,productivity,custom
http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/10/31/an-alternative-to-democracy/,An Alternative to Democracy,"&nbsp;&ldquo;In Glen&rsquo;s voting mechanism, every voter can vote as many times as he or she likes. The catch, however, is that you have to pay each time you vote, and the amount you have to pay is a function of the square of the number of votes you cast. As a consequence, each extra vote you cast costs more than the previous vote. Just for the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s say the first vote costs you $1. Then to vote a second time would cost $4. The third vote would be $9, the fourth $16, and so on. One hundred votes would cost you $10,000. So eventually, no matter how much you like a candidate, you choose to vote a finite number of times. [...] This voting scheme can work in any situation where there are multiple people trying to choose between two alternatives &mdash; e.g., a group of people trying to decide which movie or restaurant to go to, housemates trying to decide which of two TV&rsquo;s to buy, etc. In settings like those, the pool of money that is collected from people voting would be divided equally and then redistributed to the participants. My hope is that a few of you might be inspired to give this sort of voting scheme a try. If you do, I definitely want to hear about how it works out!&rdquo;",www.freakonomics.com,2016-12-09,1.0,politicalscience,custom

Why Nations Fail is easy to read, with lots of interesting historical stories about different countries. It makes an argument that is appealingly simple: countries with &lsquo;inclusive&rsquo; political and economic institutions are the ones that succeed and survive over the long term. Ultimately, though, the book is a major disappointment. I found the authors&rsquo; analysis vague and simplistic. Beyond their &lsquo;inclusive vs. extractive&rsquo; view of political and economic institutions, they largely dismiss all other factors&mdash;history and logic notwithstanding.

This does not make sense, because same-sex unions promote the values conservatives prize. Marriage is one of the basic building blocks of our neighborhoods and our nation. At its best, it is a stable bond between two individuals who work to create a loving household and a social and economic partnership. We encourage couples to marry because the commitments they make to one another provide benefits not only to themselves but also to their families and communities. Marriage requires thinking beyond one&rsquo;s own needs. It transforms two individuals into a union based on shared aspirations, and in doing so establishes a formal investment in the well-being of society. The fact that individuals who happen to be gay want to share in this vital social institution is evidence that conservative ideals enjoy widespread acceptance.

Collectively, their votes shape public policy. Yet an individual legislator knows that her vote will seldom decide the fate of a given bill. It will however contribute to the shaping of her image. Given that the individual Member of Congress controls his vote but does not control the outcome of legislative battles, he often has reason to vote based on how he would like to be seen. Often the positions a legislator wants to be seen to support and the policy outcomes he favors are closely aligned. Yet when the two diverge he has political reason to vote for what he wants to be seen to favor, rather than the legislative outcome actually he favors.

But there are many possible reasons for voting. Some people vote because they enjoy it, and would have nothing better to do with the time saved if they did not. Others are motivated by a sense of civic duty that does not assess the rationality of voting in terms of the possible impact of one&rsquo;s own ballot. [...] If these considerations fail to get people to the polls, however, compulsory voting is one way of overcoming the free-rider problem.

Second, I draw on principles of moral psychology, cognitive science, and evolutionary theory to explain why moral realism appears to be true even though it is not.

I consider a number of standard views concerning the practical implications of moral anti-realism and reject them.

In chapter 4, &lsquo;Poverty as Capability Deprivation,&rsquo; Sen argues that poverty is often narrowly construed as a lack of income. This definition, however, fails to encapsulate the fact that someone can be impoverished even with financial resources. One example he uses to explain this is that of unemployment. Even if someone is able to be recouped the financial loss caused by unemployment, not being able to sustain one&rsquo;s self through employment shows a certain poverty of dignity that most would not want to subject themselves to. This is evidenced by the uneasiness we have when unemployed and being stuck with the question &lsquo;well, what do you do?&rsquo; in social situations. Poverty is not only a lack of financial resources, but is more broadly a lack of capabilities to fulfill basic human needs.&rdquo;",essentiallyinterdependent.blogspot.com,2017-02-16,1.0,policy,custom

But there is skepticism over the effectiveness of this, highlighted by phrases like &ldquo;shirking from home&rdquo;. We report the results of the first randomized experiment on home-working in a 13,000 employee NASDAQ listed Chinese firm. Call center employees who volunteered to work from home were randomized by even/odd birth-date in a 9-month experiment of working at home or in the office. We find a 12% increase in performance from home-working, of which 8.5% is from working more minutes of per shift (fewer breaks and sick-days) and 3.5% from higher performance per minute (quieter working environment). We find no negative spillovers onto workers left in the office. Home workers also reported substantially higher work satisfaction and psychological attitude scores, and their job attrition rates fell by 50%. Despite this ex post success, the impact of home-working was ex ante unclear to the firm, which is why it ran the experiment. Employees were also ex ante uncertain, with one half of employees changing their minds on home working after the experiment. This highlights how the impact of new management practices are unclear to both firms and employees.&rdquo;",www.econ.brown.edu,2017-02-17,1.0,productivity,custom

Even if construction work is widely regarded as permissible, there is no risk of everyone doing it, and hence no risk of disaster. Similarly for choosing not to have children. As these cases suggest, the relevant question turns out to be, not &lsquo;what if everyone did that?&rsquo;, but rather, &lsquo;what if everyone felt free to do that?&rsquo; The answer to this latter question will often be, appropriately enough, &lsquo;no problem!&rsquo;&rdquo;",www.philosophyetc.net,2017-04-18,1.0,effectivealtruism,custom

Good on it, but that&rsquo;s not the end of the story. Even if we did have a system that produces judgements on which we can all agree, what then? How to we translate that theoretical triumph into the actual end goal of moral enquiry: encouraging moral behaviour?

In this article I shall take the two issues together, and try to show that they do not merit the amount of attention they have been given. I shall argue that the differences between the contending parties are terminological, and that there are various possible terminologies, none of which has, on balance, any great advantage over any other terminology. So instead of continuing to regard these issues as central, moral philosophers could, I believe, &lsquo;agree to disagree&rsquo; about the &lsquo;is-ought&rsquo; problem, and about the definition of morality, provided only that everyone was careful to stipulate how he was using the term &lsquo;moral&rsquo; and was aware of the implications and limitations of the definition he was using.

People came into this mess with very different views about how the economy works, and the crisis in effect provided natural experiments that tested those views. Most notably, what we got was a test of demand-side versus supply-side stories about the nature of depressions. [...] How could you tell which story was right? One answer was to look at the behavior of interest rates; the other was to look at inflation. For if you believed a demand-side story, you would also believe that even a large monetary expansion would have little inflationary effect; if you believed a supply-side story, you would expect lots of inflation from too much money chasing a reduced supply of goods. And indeed, people on the right have been forecasting runaway inflation for years now. Yet the predicted inflation keeps not coming.&rdquo;",krugman.blogs.nytimes.com,2017-08-03,1.0,policy,custom

And there are plenty of good non-moral or prudential reasons for doing so, such as that social living benefits us, and it&rsquo;s a darn sight easier to live socially when there are rules of conduct. So you be moral. [...] And once you&rsquo;ve chosen to be moral, that binds you to playing by the rules of the moral system you&rsquo;re in. Like when you agree to play a game of cricket, you can&rsquo;t just go around breaking or conforming to particular rules, or making up new ones, willy nilly.

It is argued first that (1) is not the best explanation of the evidence from moral practice, and second that even if it were, the error theory would still be mistaken, because the assumption does not contaminate the meaning or truth-conditions of moral claims.

Sartre&rsquo;s main point &ndash; that no one else can tell you who you are, and you choose what your own values are &ndash; seems so cliched, so much like what an uncreative graduation speaker might say &ndash; that it hardly seems worth elevating him to the Canon Of Philosophical Greatness. My hypothesis &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true &ndash; is that this is only cliched now because Sartre won. The point of studying Sartre is not to learn that you choose your own identity, but to read him backward &ndash; to start with this idea that choosing your own identity is obvious, and then read Sartre to learn exactly how controversial it was at the time and what sorts of arguments Sartre had to go through to get people to accept it, and eventually understand the position that the original reader of Sartre was supposed to have started with.&rdquo;",slatestarcodex.com,2019-01-16,1.0,philosophy,custom

Pinker presents a tremendous amount of evidence that humans have gradually become much less violent and much more humane. The trend started thousands of years ago and has continued to this day.

In the course of a confidential medical history, a doctor hears her patient is suffering from stress-related complaints after having sent an innocent man to prison. The doctor wants to know whether it is ethical to report the matter to the police. The Times&rsquo; columnist says yes &ndash; it would save the poor prisoner. Leah says no &ndash; violating medical confidentiality creates an expectation that medical confidentiality will be violated in the future, thus dooming patients who are too afraid to talk about drug use or gay sex or other potentially embarrassing but important medical risk factors.

http://utilitarian-essays.com/robustness-against-uncertainty.html,Charity Cost-Effectiveness in an Uncertain World," &nbsp;&ldquo;Evaluating the effectiveness of our actions, or even just whether they&rsquo;re positive or negative by our values, is very difficult. One approach is to focus on clear, quantifiable metrics and assume that the larger, indirect considerations just kind of work out. Another way to deal with uncertainty is to focus on actions that seem likely to have generally positive effects across many scenarios, and often this approach amounts to meta-level activities like encouraging positive-sum institutions, philosophical inquiry, and effective altruism in general. When we consider flow-through effects of our actions, the seemingly vast gaps in cost-effectiveness among charities are humbled to more modest differences, and we begin to find more worth in the diversity of activities that different people are pursuing. Those who have abnormal values may be more wary of a general &ldquo;promote wisdom&rdquo; approach to shaping the future, but it seems plausible that all value systems will ultimately benefit in expectation from a more cooperative and reflective future populace.&rdquo;",utilitarian-essays.com,2019-02-23,1.0,costeffectiveness,custom
http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whynojobs,The Reason So Many People are Unemployed," &nbsp;&ldquo;A good way to wrap your head around this is to think about a much smaller case: instead of the whole economy, let&rsquo;s think about a now-famous babysitting co-op on Capitol Hill. Instead of dollars, the co-op used its own scrip that was worth an hour of babysitting time. When you wanted to go out, you&rsquo;d pay a couple hours to someone else to watch your kids; then when they wanted to go out, they&rsquo;d pay you or someone else to do the same for them. It all worked great for a while, until one day they found they had too few pieces of scrip. Every couple had only a couple hours left and, having so little, they didn&rsquo;t want to waste it. So they all decided to save it for a very special occasion. This was kind of an incredible situation &mdash; even though there were people who wanted someone to babysit their kids, and people who were willing to do just that, the deal didn&rsquo;t happen, simply because the co-op hadn&rsquo;t printed enough colored pieces of paper. Eventually the co-op learned their mistake, printed some more scrip and handed it out, and everybody went back to babysitting like before and were much happier for it.&rdquo;",www.aaronsw.com,2019-02-24,1.0,economics,custom

[&hellip;] The basic idea is: government could save a lot of money if some problem got fixed. For example, if people stopped committing crime, they could spend less money on prisons. So they make a deal with a corporation. The corporation agrees to spend a certain amount of money to prevent crime for five years. And if crime goes down and the government saves on prisons, the corporation gets half the savings (or a third, or whatever). Zero taxpayer money gets risked. It is entirely up to the corporation to fund the problem-solving effort. If they fail, then it&rsquo;s their own loss. If they succeed, then the government pays them money, but less than the government made, so the taxpayers still get a profit. [&hellip;] This is looking impressively close to prediction markets. Futarchy says &lsquo;vote on values, bet on beliefs&rsquo;. Asking a corporation to invest money in crime-solving is a form of betting on belief &ndash; they are betting on what anti-crime programs will decrease crime most and win them the most reward.

There is medium evidence that this is also true for upper-to-medium-tier colleges. It is still easy to get into medium-to-lower-tier colleges. Until 1900, there was no competition for top colleges, medical schools, or law schools. A secular trend towards increasing admissions (increasing wealth + demand for skills?) plus two shocks from the GI Bill and the Vietnam draft led to a glut of applicants that overwhelmed schools and forced them to begin selecting applicants. Changes up until ten years ago were because of a growing applicant pool, after which the applicant pool (both domestic and international) stopped growing and started shrinking. Increased competition since ten years ago does not involve applicant pool size. Changes after ten years ago are less clear, but the most important factor is probably the ease of applying to more colleges. [&hellip;] All the hand-wringing about getting into good colleges is probably a waste of time, unless you are from a disadvantaged background. For most people, admission to a more selective college does not translate into a more lucrative career or a higher chance of admission to postgraduate education.

https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/19/teachers-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/,Teachers: Much More Than You Wanted to Know,"&ldquo;In summary: teacher quality probably explains 10% of the variation in same-year test scores. A +1 SD better teacher might cause a +0.1 SD year-on-year improvement in test scores. This decays quickly with time and is probably disappears entirely after four or five years, though there may also be small lingering effects. It&rsquo;s hard to rule out the possibility that other factors, like endogenous sorting of students, or students&rsquo; genetic potential, contributes to this as an artifact, and most people agree that these sorts of scores combine some signal with a lot of noise. For some reason, even though teachers&rsquo; effects on test scores decay very quickly, studies have shown that they have significant impact on earning as much as 20 or 25 years later, so much so that kindergarten teacher quality can predict thousands of dollars of difference in adult income. This seemingly unbelievable finding has been replicated in quasi-experiments and even in real experiments and is difficult to banish. Since it does not happen through standardized test scores, the most likely explanation is that it involves non-cognitive factors like behavior. I really don&rsquo;t know whether to believe this and right now I say 50-50 odds that this is a real effect or not &ndash; mostly based on low priors rather than on any weakness of the studies themselves.

The loss of trust mostly isn&rsquo;t the pollsters&rsquo; fault. It&rsquo;s the media&rsquo;s fault. Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m going there. The loss of trust in polls was enabled, in large part, by reporting and analysis that incorrectly portrayed the polls as showing an almost-certain Clinton win when in fact they showed a close and highly uncertain Electoral College race[. &hellip;] Not only do polls have a margin of sampling error [&hellip;] but they also have other types of errors, such as nonresponse bias. [&hellip;] So then, to calculate the overall error in a poll &mdash; what I&rsquo;ll call the true margin of error &mdash; you add the margin of sampling error and the margin of methodological error together, right? No, not quite. Instead, you need a sum of squares formula. To save you some math, here are a few useful benchmarks: For a high-quality, 1,000-person national poll, a good estimate of the true margin of error is about plus or minus 4 percentage points. For a national polling average, meanwhile, the true margin of error is about plus or minus 3 percentage points. [&hellip;] That means for a high-quality, 1,000-person national poll, the true margin of error for the margin between candidates &mdash; or a candidate&rsquo;s net approval rating &mdash; is about 8 percentage points.

https://www.benkuhn.net/options,Stock options are really complicated," &nbsp;&ldquo;Owning stock options is different (and worse) than directly owning equity in a company. That&rsquo;s because you need to exercise them&ndash;i.e., pay the company money&ndash;in order to exchange the option for &nbsp;actual shares. Exercising the options costs a lot of money, so all else equal you would want to wait until the you&rsquo;re sure the stock is valuable to exercise. (For instance, you might wait until the company goes public, so you know you can sell the stock on the stock market.) But there are two downsides to that approach. First, depending on your company&rsquo;s policies, you might have to give up your options if you leave or are fired. Second, if you sell the stock too soon after you exercise the options, you&rsquo;ll get much worse tax treatment. That means &nbsp;you&rsquo;ll be caught between (a) paying twice as much in taxes as an equity holder, or (b) risking losing most of your gains because the stock price moved against you at the wrong time. So from a tax perspective, the best time to exercise the options is as soon as they&rsquo;re granted to you (before they even vest). This is known as &ldquo;early exercise&rdquo; or an &ldquo;83(b) election.&rdquo; Unfortunately, early exercise can cost a lot of money up front, and if the company doesn&rsquo;t succeed, you&rsquo;ll lose it all. That makes the decision process kind of complicated.&rdquo;",,2019-10-23,1.0,career,custom

https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1180151670744834053,Neoliberalism: a thread," &nbsp;&ldquo;To most of the people who bash &lsquo;neoliberalism&rsquo;, the word means free-market libertarianism - the ideology of Milton Friedman, Margaret Thatcher, and Ronald Reagan. But to the people who call themselves &lsquo;neoliberal&rsquo; now, it does not mean that. The people who now call themselves &ldquo;neoliberals&rdquo; are the heirs to a different tradition - the liberals of the 1990s who responded to the failure of communism and the excesses of libertarianism by creating a new, center-left technocratic policy program. [&hellip;] Neoliberalism, as defined by its current adherents (rather than by its squawking enemies), views markets as the fundamental generators of prosperity, and government as the way to distribute that prosperity more equitably. [&hellip;] It sees free trade and globalization, along with strong welfare states in rich countries, as the best way to make the world more prosperous and more equal at the same time. [&hellip;] Now, am I really a neoliberal? [..] No. I am not[. ..] I&rsquo;ve come to believe in export promotion, which is anathema to many neoliberals, since it&rsquo;s a restriction on free trade. [&hellip;] The government *must* pick winners. Green energy and other zero-carbon technologies being chief among the things we must pick. I also believe in national health insurance, which is just straight-up nationalization of a major industry. So there are many ways in which my economic ideas diverge strongly from neoliberalism (that was not an exhaustive list). But just because I&rsquo;m not really a neoliberal doesn&rsquo;t mean I think neoliberalism is bad. I think it&rsquo;s a valuable perspective we still need. Just as free-market libertarianism went too far, so will the new socialism go too far someday (if it ever manages to take power). We will need people who remember the value of markets, but who are NOT plutocrats or racists, to temper and restrain that overreach. If the job of restraining the inevitable excesses of socialism doesn&rsquo;t fall to the Clintonite technocratic center-left, it will fall to the right - to libertarians, racist &ldquo;economic nationalists&rdquo;, etc. And that would be bad. Neoliberals&rsquo; disagreement with leftists comes less from their goals - both want a prosperous, equal society - but from the methods they think will be most effective for getting there. And that is a healthy disagreement. Or it should be, anyway.&rdquo;",twitter.com,2019-11-02,1.0,policy,custom

The most important thing to remember is that success in subscription video services requires two things: Getting a subscriber, and keeping a subscriber. The second is harder. Much harder. And since we are giving out free advice, here are 10 tips for the current and future contenders: 1. Spend today on the content library that will make financial sense five years from now. [&hellip;, ] 2. The only arbiters of the quality of your content and service is the audience. [&hellip;] Audiences like content that is &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; They even like pretending they don&rsquo;t like certain content and will go out of their way to complain about it. [&hellip;] You probably need more content than you think. If your audience isn&rsquo;t complaining about having too many series they want to watch, they&rsquo;ll pause their subscription and come back when you have them. [&hellip;] At a certain point, the value of unwatched content is negative, not zero. [&hellip;] You don&rsquo;t need sophisticated metrics to tell if your audience likes your content. All you need to know is, &ldquo;Are they coming back?&rdquo; The more complicated the analysis, the more likely it has been exaggerated. 3. The best way to build your streaming subscription service is to rebrand and cannibalize another business that already has lots of users and, ideally, money. [&hellip;] 4. If you actually want to make money, subscription streaming shouldn&rsquo;t even be your real business. Instead, give it away as a free or low-cost perk that&rsquo;s part of a much higher-margin and less-competitive business, such as wireless service, smartphones, e-commerce subscriptions, or theme park passes. [&hellip;] 6. Ultimately, you need hits. A single breakout can double your subscriber growth (though again, you&rsquo;ll need more hits to keep these subscribers), but a bunch of niche &ldquo;hits&rdquo; makes only for a niche service. Unfortunately, these hits are hard to produce and even harder to predict. So when you think you&rsquo;ve got one, pay whatever it takes to get the rights, reshoot a pilot, or fix the creative. [&hellip;] 9. To be successful, you have to solve a problem. This cannot be a problem you created. A few hardcore fans might chase Jim and Pam across the streaming landscape, but most will just watch something other than The Office. But if you say, &ldquo;We are the home for all things Marvel,&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll happily choose you over sifting through Triple Frontier and The Ridiculous Six to find Thor: Ragnarok.&rdquo;",,2019-12-04,1.0,entrepreneurship,custom

Sunstein, co-author of Nudge, Obama White House official, and by far the most cited legal scholar of the late 2000s, aims to unravel the mystery and figure out the implications in his new book How Change Happens. He pulls together three phenomena which social scientists have studied in recent decades: preference falsification, variable thresholds for action, and group polarisation. If Sunstein is to be believed, together these are a cocktail for social shifts that are chaotic and fundamentally unpredictable. In brief, people constantly misrepresent their true views, even to close friends and family. They themselves aren&rsquo;t quite sure how socially acceptable their feelings would have to become before they revealed them or joined a campaign for change. And a chance meeting between a few strangers can be the spark that radicalises a handful of people who then find a message that can spread their beliefs to millions. According to Sunstein, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;much, much easier&rdquo; to create social change when large numbers of people secretly or latently agree with you.

For Democrats the share was just over six percent in 1972, but it&rsquo;s dropped in half by 2018. For Republicans the climb has been upward, with just under 5% being totally opposed to abortion in 1972 compared to 8.5% of Republicans in 2018. [&hellip;T]he share of Republicans who wanted to place no restrictions on abortion was the same as the Democrats in the 1970&rsquo;s. Then, support for that position began to drop. However, the decline was much steeper for Republicans &ndash; 40% of Republican were totally pro-choice in the 1970&rsquo;s, but that fell to just under 15% by the mid-2000&rsquo;s, only to rebound about five percentage points recently. The Democrats have seen a slightly different pattern. From their high of 37% completely pro-choice in the early 1970&rsquo;s, they dropped to just above 20% in the mid-2000&rsquo;s. There was a big bounce back for Democrats, though. Now about 35% of Democrats could be called completely pro-choice. The gap between two parties on the 100% pro-choice group is now the largest it&rsquo;s ever been, with Democrats being twice as likely to always favor abortion than Republicans. One would have to think that an individual&rsquo;s view of abortion is based, in large part, on their religious tradition. The data largely confirms that, but there are some interesting results. Of the group of people who favor a woman&rsquo;s choice to an abortion in all six scenarios, just over a third are religiously unaffiliated. However, the group that shows up the second most is Catholics. Obviously, that&rsquo;s a function of the size of the Catholic population in the United States, but it also speaks to the fact that lots of Catholics are diametrically opposed to the Church&rsquo;s teaching on abortion. That comes even more into focus when considering that despite the fact that evangelicals made up nearly a quarter of the sample, they are just 12.7% of 100% pro-choice respondents. When looking at those who are 100% pro-life, it&rsquo;s basically evangelicals, Catholics, and then everyone else.

In the reverse case, a time-traveler from the past to the future wishes to prove he is from the past and that time-travel is real. How can he do this when all past knowledge is already known or whose chain of custody being broken is more likely than time-travel being real? I suggest 8 methods: carbon-14 nuclear isotope dating of their body as isotopes cannot be removed; sequencing of their genome to check consistency with pedigree as human genomes cannot be synthesized or edited on a large scale; selection & mutation clocks, likewise; immune system signatures of extinct or rare diseases such as smallpox, and accumulated pollution such as heavy metals, difficult & dangerous to fake.

[However,] Russian procurement dwarfs that of most European powers combined. [...] The reason for this apparent contradiction is that the use of market exchange rates grossly understates the real volume of Russian military expenditure (and that of other countries with smaller per-capita incomes, like China). Instead, any analysis of comparative military expenditure should be based on the use of purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates rather than market exchange rates. [...] As we demonstrate, despite some shortcomings, PPP is a much more methodologically robust and defensible method of comparing defense spending across countries[. ...] Using PPP, one finds that Russia's effective military expenditure actually ranged between $150 billion and $180 billion annually over the last five years. That figure is conservative; taking into account hidden or obfuscated military expenditure, Russia may well come in at around $200 billion. [...] The gap is even narrower when one digs into the differences in how this money is spent. At nearly 50 percent of federal budget spending on national defense, a large proportion of the Russian defense budget goes to procurement and research and development. By comparison, in other countries with large defense budgets, procurement spending tends to be much lower: in India, the United States, and the United Kingdom, spending is at about 20–25 percent. Unlike some other large military spenders - for example, Saudi Arabia and India - Russia also produces most of its weaponry itself and does not buy its equipment from countries with higher costs.&rdquo;",warontherocks.com,2019-12-25,1.0,nationalsecurity,custom

Moreover, even satisfying all three conditions approximately requires that the data lie in an approximate version of one of the constrained special cases identified by our theorem.

Performance on a separate test set used only once determined the final ranking. By systematically comparing the public ranking with the final ranking, we assess how much participants adapted to the holdout set over the course of a competition. Our study shows, somewhat surprisingly, little evidence of substantial overfitting.

In this paper we undertake a thorough evaluation of the performance of various climate models published between the early 1970s and the late 2000s. Specifically, we look at how well models project global warming in the years after they were published by comparing them to observed temperature changes. Model projections rely on two things to accurately match observations: accurate modeling of climate physics, and accurate assumptions around future emissions of CO2 and other factors affecting the climate. The best physics‐based model will still be inaccurate if it is driven by future changes in emissions that differ from reality. To account for this, we look at how the relationship between temperature and atmospheric CO2 (and other climate drivers) differs between models and observations. We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO2 and other climate drivers. This research should help resolve public confusion around the performance of past climate modeling efforts, and increases our confidence that models are accurately projecting global warming.&rquo;",agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com,2019-12-25,1.0,policy,custom

Does that sound awful or awesome? The manager's strength is proportional to the team, and motivating the team to find the answers is more of the goal than having all the answers yourself. Good managers need to remind the team *why* things are done more often than *how*, to create motivation. Sometimes good people don't work out on good teams, you usually will only regret moving on from a struggling person too late not too early. Respect for a manager is more important than approval.

Am I consuming stimulants multiple times per day to hide my exhaustion? Am I sitting still and staring at screens for most of my waking hours? Do I interact with people primarily through screens? Am I indoors all day long, depriving myself of fresh air and sunlight? Do I depend on alcohol or drugs to cope with social situations outside of work?

You’re convinced a locker-style combination lock will outsmart a crook. He pops it in seconds with a shim—just slides it in between the body of the lock and its fishhook tip, and your bike is his. (A good bandit can make a shim in about five minutes with nothing more than a beer can and a pair of scissors.) U-locks? Routinely opened with a Bic pen jammed into the keyhole. Even with that rare unbreakable lock, a bike is no safer than its anchor; outside Guthrie Hall at the University of Washington sits a metal rack that bike thieves have sawed straight through. The components, meanwhile—the lights, seats, handlebars, derailleurs, and brakes that turn a frame into a ridable bike—can go for hundreds of dollars each on the black market.

Instead, a scanning electron microscope is &ldquo;a needle with a point that is a single atom (literally, it is the pointiest thing possible) which it uses to measure subtle electrical variations (such as a stray atom sitting on what was otherwise a very flat, clean surface). The 'Tunneling Electron' bit of the name refers to the nature of the electrical interaction being used to detect the presence of atoms; when the tip is brought close to an atom electrons will quantum tunnel between them and the exchange of electrons is a detectable as a current. The 'Scanning' bit of the name refers to how this is used to generate a picture: by scanning back and forth across a surface over and over until you’ve bumped every atom with your needle several times. The pictures so generated aren’t photographs, they’re maps of what the STM’s needle experienced as it was moved over the surface. The STM 'sees' atoms using this needle in the same way you can 'see' the bottom of a muddy river with a pokin’ stick.&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;",www.askamathematician.com,2019-12-30,1.0,science,custom

Although this was generally regarded as an impressive achievement, it quickly became clear that not everybody was satisfied with how the AI agent, called AlphaStar, interacted with the game, or how its creator, DeepMind, presented it. Many observers complained that, in spite of DeepMind’s claims that it performed at similar speeds to humans, AlphaStar was able to control the game with greater speed and accuracy than any human, and that this was the reason why it prevailed. Although I think this story is mostly correct, I think it is harder than it looks to compare AlphaStar’s interaction with the game to that of humans, and to determine to what extent this mattered for the outcome of the matches.

Nutritional facts panels may serve to mitigate some of these concerns, but there is little doubt that labels create various taste and health halos that extend beyond the objective facts. At the same time, words are needed to convey meaning to consumers beyond just animal content.  Using the word ground “meat” tells me something about how the food is expected to be cooked and served and which condiments are appropriate.  In this instance, using “meat” with “plant-based” is helpful to the consumer insofar as quickly conveying key information about how the product is to be cooked and consumed.

[...] I bought an extremely bright “corn cob” style bulb. It emits as much light as about 40 incandescents, and produces enough waste heat that it needs an internal cooling fan to dissipate it. [...] The effect was huge: I became dramatically more productive between 3:30pm and whenever I turned off the light. Instead of having a strong urge to stop working whenever it got dark out, I was able to keep working my normal summer schedule, stopping just before dinner.

Consider the common objection to Effective Altruism, that it allegedly 'neglects the need for systemic change.' [...] EAs advocate that everyone donate at least 10% of their incomes to effective causes.  If that happened, the world would be radically transformed: ending extreme poverty, material deprivation, and easily preventable disease, forever.  So if that's not a ""systemic change"", I don't know what is. Admittedly, what we're calling for (in the first instance) is change to the behaviour of agents in the system, rather than changes to the rules of the system. [...] Altruistic political expression is easier to secure than altruistic (non-political) behaviour, so we should use the former to force the latter, e.g. by redistributive taxation.

At a more granular level, none of the pieces of Trump trade strategy have worked as promised. Although Trump has repeatedly insisted that China is paying his tariffs, the facts say otherwise[...] At the same time, Chinese retaliation has hit some U.S. exporters, farmers in particular, hard.

Citizen complaints, if anything, go down. Violence against police falls. And there is no increase in officer-caused deaths. In terms of magnitudes, the fall in crime is substantial given the cost: the Warwick-NHH paper finds the value of reduced crime, using standard metrics, is roughly 20 times the cost of the military equipment. Interestingly, places that get this equipment also hire fewer cops, suggesting some sort of substitutability between labor and capital in policing. The one negative finding, in the Tennessee paper, is that arrests for petty crimes appear to rise in a minor way.

It does. Better to ask whether the DF-17 significantly enhances the threat from China’s formidable arsenal of existing weapons [...] The Pentagon’s budget request for fiscal 2020 included $2.6 billion for hypersonic-related research, and there is a strong appetite in Washington for deploying hypersonic weapons as soon as possible. But the Defense Department would be wise to move cautiously. Hypersonic weapons may ultimately find their niche in U.S. military strategy, but first the Pentagon must define their role and analyze potential alternatives. For now, defending against current – and particularly future – Chinese hypersonic weapons is a more urgent task.""",carnegieendowment.org,2020-01-04,1.0,nationalsecurity,Acton

Their goal is to improve employment outcomes for those with criminal records, with a secondary goal of reducing racial disparities in employment. However, removing information about job applicants’ criminal histories could lead employers who don’t want to hire ex-offenders to guess who the ex-offenders are, and avoid interviewing them. [...] We find that BTB policies decrease the probability of being employed by 3.4 percentage points (5.1%) for young, low-skilled black men, and by 2.3 percentage points (2.9%) for young, low-skilled Hispanic men. These findings support the hypothesis that when an applicant’s criminal history is unavailable, employers statistically discriminate against demographic groups that include more ex-offenders.",jenniferdoleac.com,2020-01-04,1.0,policy,Custom

[...] It’s possible that Trump could become more popular in the wake of this month’s attacks thanks to something called the “rally-around-the-flag effect,” or the idea that major international crises can unite the country around the commander-in-chief. [...] In addition, factors like the seriousness of the event, whether the country is already fatigued by war, the president’s approval rating before the event, and the level of media coverage of the event can all influence the size of the rally-around-the-flag effect, or even whether there is one at all.",fivethirtyeight.com,2020-01-09,1.0,politicalscience,538

Ballot initiatives appear to maintain several advantages over more traditional policy lobbying, including lower barriers to entry and more direct control over the final legislation. However, the ultimate cost-effectiveness of a ballot initiative campaign depends on several factors, many of which are difficult to specify precisely.

They can also be judged by Rawls’ liberal concern for minimal degrees of intervention in order to respect the rights and institutions of other peoples. As for ethical consequences, Americans can ask whether a president succeeded in promoting the country’s long-term national interests, but also whether he respected cosmopolitan values regarding human life by avoiding extreme insularity totally discounts harm to foreigners. The example that leaders set also has important moral consequences, as does whether they are promoting truth and trust that broadens moral discourse at home and abroad.

The demand for transparency seems so innocuous. Who could be against greater transparency? But transparency is inimical to privacy. And we care about privacy in part, because we can be more honest and truthful in private than in public.

This also means that instead of verbal reasoning, BERT may learn to rely on various shortcuts, biases and artifacts in the datasets to arrive at the correct prediction.

Having neglected to take adequate account of the role of power in society, we have allowed power to concentrate in ways that make reforming the system very difficult. Economic growth, economists like to say, is a positive-sum affair. If you make the right policies, then you ought to end up sufficiently rich as a society that winners from policy shifts can compensate losers and everyone ends up better off than they were before. This is the sunny picture that people on the other side of the rift—those more or less happy with the status quo—like to share with each other. It’s an appealing image! Because if no one has to lose, then everyone can get on board and no one has to feel bad. But if power is the problem, then you have a different situation. Power is necessarily zero-sum.

Mitt Romney (R-UT) teamed up with Michael Bennet (D-CO) to endorse an expansion of the child tax credit. Crucially, the bill includes something essential to the economic security of families: a child allowance. If the government would give money to all parents, no matter their income, it would solve two major problems facing Democrats. First, by helping both rich and poor families, parents as well as children, it would unite groups that are often pitted against one another. Second, it could be passed through the process known as reconciliation, which expedites budget bills. This means if Democrats control Congress and the White House next year, the law could go into effect quickly, helping millions of families almost immediately.""",www.thenation.com,2020-01-24,1.0,policy,Twitter

Researchers have found that instead, in countries around the world, the accumulation of wealth also often leads to accumulation of political power that is then harnessed to multiply that wealth. Indeed, that’s what we’re seeing in America. Our political system responds to large donors, so politicians create benefits for the rich, who then reward the politicians who created them.

[...] We theorize and find evidence that security threats––like terrorism––are not the only factors driving proliferation. Regime type also has a significant effect, but it varies over time. From 1994-2010 regime type had no significant effect, but non-democracies became significantly more likely to pursue and obtain armed drones from 2011-2019 due to the concurrence of three shocks in time, the most important of which asymmetrically eased supply-side constraints for non-democracies. We also find that status-seeking states are more likely to pursue armed drones.

Researchers – often implicitly – assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these “standard subjects” are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species – frequent outliers.

The present study complements this motivational explanation with the parsimonious cognitive explanation that the phrase “average ability” may be interpreted as below-median ability rather than median ability. We believe people tend to construe an “average” target that is based on the most representative exemplar, and this result in different levels of “average” in different domains. [...] For abilities perceived as easy (e.g., spoken and written expression), participants construed an “average” target at the 40th percentile (i.e., below-median ability) and showed a marked better-than-average effect.

Whatever your training, you should view any invitation to violence as an opportunity to die—or to be sent to prison for killing another human being. (3) Do whatever you can to avoid a physical confrontation, but the moment avoidance fails, attack explosively for the purposes of escape. However bad your options may appear in the moment, complying with the demands of a person who is seeking to control your movements is a terrible idea. Recognizing when this line has been crossed, and committing to escape at any cost, is more important than mastering physical techniques. The moment it is clear that an assailant wants more than your property (which must be assumed in any home invasion), you must escape.",samharris.org,2020-02-10,1.0,productivity,Custom

Was Dickens writing his story as an attack on economics, capitalism, and selfishness? After all, his depiction of Ebenezer Scrooge, along with his use of phrases like ""decrease the surplus population"" and ""a good man of business"" would suggest as much, and a classic example of such an interpretation is here. Or was Dickens just telling a good story with distinct characters? After all, Scrooge is portrayed as an outlier in the business community. The warm portrayal of Mr. Fezziwig certainly opens the possibility that one can be a successful man of business as well as a good employer and a decent human being.

First, if you have no unusual information about a question, you should start with the same opinions as the broad coalition of trustworthy people would have. But their opinions are not the last word, and as you get more evidence, it can be reasonable to disagree. Second, a complete prior probability distribution specifies, for any possible set of evidence, what posterior probabilities you should have.

From this perspective, the birds are a native species that has been around since long before people introduced fish farms, sport fishing, and lake houses into their environment, and a conservation success story after their rebound from the devastating impacts of the insecticide DDT.

This type of code makes up the digital infrastructure of our society today. Just like physical infrastructure, digital infrastructure needs regular upkeep and maintenance. [...] But financial support for digital infrastructure is much harder to come by. [...] No individual company or organization is incentivized to address the problem alone, because open source code is a public good. In order to support our digital infrastructure, we must find ways to work together. [...] Any support strategy needs to accept and work with the decentralized, community-centric qualities of open source code. Increasing awareness of the problem, making it easier for institutions to contribute time and money, expanding the pool of open source contributors, and developing best practices and policies across infrastructure projects will all go a long way in building a healthy and sustainable ecosystem.""",www.fordfoundation.org,2020-02-15,1.0,technology,Eghbal

Although some of this is confounded by improved screening, this is unlikely to explain more than about 20-50% of the effect. The remainder is probably a real improvement in treatment.

Sycamore isn’t nearly powerful enough to break crypto keys and the calculation it did is arguably… a little pointless. Sycamore was given a series of random quantum circuits to simulate, which it was able to do. Barely. According to Google, “Our largest random quantum circuits have 53 qubits, 1113 single-qubit gates, 430 two-qubit gates, and a measurement on each qubit, for which we predict a total fidelity of 0.2%.” That 0.2% isn’t how often it fails, that’s how often it works.

https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jG8pptGksBpzyTxYg/a-qualitative-analysis-of-value-drift-in-ea-1,A Qualitative Analysis of Value Drift in EA,"""Value drift is a term EAs and rationalists use to refer to changes in our values over time, especially changes away from EA and other altruistic values. We want to promote morally good value changes and avoid morally bad value changes, but distinguishing between the two can be difficult since we tend to be poor judges of our own morality. EAs seem to think that value drift is most likely to affect the human population as a whole, less likely to affect the EA community, and even less likely to affect themselves. This discrepancy might be due to an overconfidence bias, so perhaps EAs ought to assume that we’re more likely to value drift than we intuitively think we are. Being connected with the EA community, getting involved in EA causes, being open to new ideas, prioritizing a sustainable lifestyle, and certain personality traits seem associated with less value drift from EA values. The study of EAs’ experiences with value drift is rather neglected, so further research is likely to be helpful.""",forum.effectivealtruism.org,2020-03-16,1.0,ethics,EAForum

In fact, the narrative that has appeared in many news reports and breathless press releases—that AI is a powerful new weapon against diseases—is only partly true and risks becoming counterproductive. For example, too much confidence in AI’s capabilities could lead to ill-informed decisions that funnel public money to unproven AI companies at the expense of proven interventions such as drug programs. It’s also bad for the field itself: overblown but disappointed expectations have led to a crash of interest in AI, and consequent loss of funding, more than once in the past.""",www.technologyreview.com,2020-03-19,1.0,technology,Email

Not Really.,"""There’s been a lot of finger pointing in the past few days over who isn’t taking the coronavirus seriously. Some have pointed to millennials out at bars or brunch, saying they are not taking recommendations to stay home and avoid crowds to prevent the spread of the virus. Others have gotten frustrated with baby boomers stubbornly carrying on with their weekly gatherings and travel plans. But when you look at recent polls, there just isn’t any evidence that one age group is more concerned than another about the spread of the disease. And furthermore, there doesn’t seem to be an age gap in people’s willingness to adopt preventive measures.""",fivethirtyeight.com,2020-03-22,1.0,politicalscience,538

Except in rare circumstances, this will lead to inefficiencies due to free-riding (defecting), and thus gains from cooperation. Free-riding comes from individuals putting resources toward causes which they personally view as neglected (being under-valued by other people’s value systems) at the expense of causes for which there is more consensus. Standard EA cause prioritization recommends that people free-ride on others' efforts to do good (at least when interacting with people not in the EA community). If existing societal norms are to cooperate when trying to do good, EA may cause harm by encouraging people to free-ride.

School is a closed-world domain—you are solving crisply-defined puzzles (multiply these two numbers, implement this algorithm, write a book report by this rubric), your solution is evaluated on one dimension (letter grade), and the performance ceiling (an A+) is low. [...] The real world is the polar opposite. [...] Because of these differences, most graduates of elite schools—including me—start out being completely unable to identify which work is actually important.

It has its loyal fans but few enjoy it. Most people want to tell others they do; sometimes people experiment with it, but mostly, people just don’t like it at all. Curious to learn about what classics people actually enjoy, I delved into the Goodreads data to find what classics users love and hate the most. The idea is not to replace reading great novels with easy, short and fun books, but to give a greater weight to the great novels that are more likely to be enjoyed by the average reader. [...] The data is quite clear. People HATE reading The Scarlet Letter.

https://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2020/03/the-ethics-of-price-gouging/,The Ethics of Price Gouging,"""In essence, “price gouging” is simply a pejorative way of referring to the use of market prices to allocate scarce resources. [...] Price gouging occurs because resources are scarce – because there aren’t enough goods to meet people’s needs. Banning price gouging doesn’t do anything to address the underlying scarcity – in fact it might even make it worse, by destroying the incentives to bring new supply to market. [...] In the end, allocation by market prices has two advantages over just about any other system of distribution. It leads people to cut back on their demand – especially those people who need the good less, and are therefore willing to pay less for it. And it encourages people who have excess supply – people who stocked up, people from non-affected communities, and producers who might be able to make more – to bring that supply to where it is needed most. [...] Prices might not be perfect. But they’re usually better than the alternative.""",bleedingheartlibertarians.com,2020-04-22,1.0,policy,BLH

Growth was fastest when low hanging fruit from fundamental inventions like electricity and gasoline engines were being rolled out across the economy.  Once that was mostly accomplished (around 1973), growth slowed. (2) Presidential policies do affect the supply side of the economy, and this can have a modest impact on growth.  Some good reforms happened during the Reagan and Clinton years. [...] (3) At business cycle frequencies, it’s mostly monetary policy that determines the path of output.

Ensure that you fulfill your key legal obligations as a charity, as you don’t want to risk losing your charity status. If you operate in two countries, you will likely need two different legal boards. The Advisory Board has no legal authority but increases the status of your organization and provides valuable advice. Make sure that you find a group of advisors that combines signaling value with experience in fundraising, research, operations, domain expertise, and general startup wisdom.

When I first hired my business coach, he asked me for an audit of my time. But there was a catch. He wanted to see the hours organized as follows: $10 per hour work... $100/hr work... $1,000/hr work... $10,000/hr work. [...] In the $10 category there was the constant re-scheduling Zoom calls, formatting Keynotes, responding to YouTube comments, and gathering my 1099s. [...] But whether you’re a business owner, executive or manager – there absolutely are daily actions that could have $10,000 outcomes in the future.""",radreads.co,2020-05-14,1.0,productivity,Custom
